    <h1>Welcome to Tidybits</h1>
    <section>
        <article>
            <p>I'm Ross, a Web Developer from the south west and this is my digital domain.</p>
            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Tidybits is more than a name, it's a philosphy, a way of working.</p>
            <h3>Simplicity</h3>
            The first tenet of the philosophy is KISS (Keep it simple, stupid) and YAGNI (You aren't gonna need it!), which means no extraneous fluff. Take this page for example, if you're so inclined, glance at the CSS and HTML:
            <ul>
                <li>There is nothing complicated here</li>
                <li>It's responsive by default, no bulky frameworks required</li>
                <li>Everything is clear and concise</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                But let's see what that means for you, the client. How does this help you reach your vision? I mean, you don't care about all of the stuff behind the curtain, right?
            of course not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clean means easy to maintain, easy to extend and expand and most importantly easy to understand and that means less cost, and more power to you. I can point to anything in the markup of this page and explain it to a non-technical person in a single sentence.
                That leads on to...
            </p>
            <h2>Communication</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest causes of project delay, failure or delivery with issues is a breakdown of communication. I pride myself on being able to talk at any level, clearly and concisely, to meet your needs and will gladly consult on projects to act as mediation between technical and non-technical stakeholders.</p>
            <h2>Planning</h2>
            <p>
                The final tenet of Tidybit-fu is planning, all of this simplicity doesn't come easy, it requires thought and a wider understanding of the final goal, this means things like GELs and style guides, architecture plans, design pattern choices all prepared in advance.
